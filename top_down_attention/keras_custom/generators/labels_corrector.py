What is this script:
--------------------
    how to correct labels from kera auto-labelled classes to true classes matching VGG's output layer indices
    For example you have a subset of categories ['dog', 'cat', 'ball'] which have
    wordnet ids ['n142', 'n99', 'n200'] and their real indices on VGG's output layer
    are [234, 101, 400]. Yet if you pass in ['n142', 'n99', 'n200'] keras will find
    corresponding image directories and label ['dog', 'cat', 'ball'] as [0, 1, 2] which
    is in the same order as the wordnet ids list you use.
    What we want, however, is for VGG to output the actual indices of these three
    classes. In other words, we want keras to label ['dog', 'cat', 'ball'] as [234, 101, 400].
    So we need to replace the auto-labelled indices with the actual indices.
